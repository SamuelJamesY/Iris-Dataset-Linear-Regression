# Iris-Dataset-Linear-Regression

Numpy, pandas and sklearn were used to develop a linear regression model which sought to classify the flower type 
as Setosa or Versicolor. 
  The predictor variable was replaced with a number 0,1,2 for Setosa, Versicolor and Virginia. 
  A train test split of 80/20 was used. The train data was fitted to a linear regression model,
  and then the flower type was predicted. This prediction was then passed through a heaviside transfer function. 
  Thirity experiments were run for the model and mean accuracy score was calculated.
